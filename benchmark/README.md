# benchmark script comparing numpy, ndarray and ha-ndarray

## what is this benchmark?
- a comparison of numpy, ndarray and ha-ndarray
- graphed with matplotlib in a python env with matplotlib / numpy
- can be built into a python env with maturin (maturin build --release)
- followed by `python benchmark.py`

## output
- creates fig.png

## Issues
- was pretty confusing -> I have no idea how the ha-ndarray crate works and if I'm implementing the right functions or hardware acceleration at all!
